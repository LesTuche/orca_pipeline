### GENREAL INFO ### 

I made this package while there was an issue with openmpi and ORCA. 

I used CHATGPT to do the package, hence there could also be errors, which the bot introduced. 

If you find a bug, either write an issue and hope that I fix it or make a pull request. 

It was not intended to be a genral purpose pipeline, rather just to implement what I needed. 

It might be that there are inconsitencies between the methods. Check the source code.

It is not intended as a black-box. Check that what it is doing is acutally what you want




###### Pre-requisite #### 

1) Install package: 

1) python -m venv --system-site-packages <venv_name>   ## If there is a conflict after installation drop the --system-site-packages

a Note about Conda enviroments from the Cluster support:

Conda uses many small files, which doesn't work well with Euler's Lustre file systems:

We therefore recommend to use:

    Home directory but be aware of the 100k file limit.
    Scratch directory but be aware of the automatic clean up policy.
    Project directory

Don't use:

    Work directory

I recommend using Python enviroments as space on HOME is limited. 


2) In you bin place

ssubo and ssubpipeline. You can find them in the scripts folder. 
 - ssubo is a submission script for ORCA on SLURM
 - ssubpipline is a submission script to run the pipeline.  


Check that your bin is part of you PATH. You can check this with echo $PATH

If not run this command  

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/your/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc

Then either do: source ~/.bashrc or disconnect and reconnect to the clulster

2) Example. 

The example input is the tst.yaml. 

The example will do the pipeline for a Diels-Alder reaction. 

It will perform the following steps: 

1) OPT: Optimized educt and prodcut. 

2) NEB-TS: NEB-TS with xtb2

3) TS: TS optimization with r2scan-3c

4) IRC: Confirm Transition state:

5) CONF: Find lowest conf on xtb2 surface with GOAT. OPtimize lowwest found with r2scan-3c.

! You might notice that the educt.xyz contains the coordinate of the cyclohexen. This is intended. NEB is usually easier to do for the "dissocation" than for the bond forming.

### INPUT #### 

check out example.yaml to get an idea of the keywords. 

You can also check run_pipeline.py in scripts, which parses the yaml.
